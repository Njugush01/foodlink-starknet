            <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl'>Our Commitment to a Hunger-Free Nation</h1>
            <p>At Food Link Kenya, our unwavering commitment is to build a nation where no one goes to bed hungry.
                 We strive to eliminate food insecurity at its roots, working tirelessly to ensure that surplus resources 
                 are redirected to those who need them most. Together, we are dedicated to creating a hunger-free environment 
                 and fostering a community where every individual has access to nourishing meals.</p>

            <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl'>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our mission is clear - to transform surplus into sustenance. We aim to bridge the gap between abundance
                 and need by creating a platform that connects surplus food providers with organizations serving the less fortunate. 
                 Through collaborative efforts, we strive to eradicate hunger, reduce food waste, and build a stronger, more 
                 compassionate society.</p>

            <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl'>Our Vision</h1>
            <p>Looking ahead, our vision is a future where no one in our nation experiences the pangs of hunger.
                 We envision thriving communities, empowered by access to nutritious meals. 
                 With a focus on sustainability and community involvement, we aspire to be a driving force in creating lasting 
                 solutions that lead us towards a hunger-free and resilient nation.</p>
